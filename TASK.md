Write a simple program that calculates the price of a shopping basket.
Items are presented one at a time, in a list, identified by name - for example "Apple" or "Banana".
The basket can contain any item multiple times.

Items are priced as follows:

* Apples are 25p each
* Oranges are 30p each
* Garlic are 15p each
* Papayas are 50p each, but are available as ‘three for the price of two’

Given a list of shopping, calculate the total cost of those items.
The output should be displayed similar to what you would expect to see on a receipt.

For Node test: The program needs to be built using NodeJS. You should focus on creating a solution that is extendable and maintanable.  User Interface is not expected.

Essentials:
* Clean code, maintainable and extendable
* Tests
* Design patterns
* Any assumptions documented
* 'usestrict';
* at least ES5

Preferred:
* Use of Functional Programming
* Edge cases coverage (basket empty, all basket items on offer,etc)
